Connect4
---------

As an exercise to practice some javascript I decided to make a javascript only connect4 game.
The board size and the winning length is customizable.

With the addition of the input fields some bugs have been introduced:
(win in topright not detected
undefined has won

future improvements:
Add 1-player support
Improve on the very basic look.
